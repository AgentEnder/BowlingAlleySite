# BowlingAlleySite
## History
This website was initially created for my senior project in national honors society. It was donated to a local bowling alley, and I maintained it for a year.
## Learning Progress
This was my first time working with php. It was also the first time I really understood jQuery.

* jQuery: First time really understanding how jQuery selectors could make use of most CSS selectors
* MySQL: First time interacting with a database to load content dynamically
* PHP: First time making use of PHP for nonstatic pages, or to include other html segments.

## Now
The site has been removed from the companies site, but I maintained the rights to the code. A generic version of the site is now live at http://www.craigorycoppola.com/projects/BowlingAlley/index
